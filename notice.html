      <h1>Important Update About PixL & Fortnite</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        Over the past few months, many of you have been confused about why Fortnite updates stopped appearing on PixL.
        Some thought the app was abandoned, some thought it was a bug, and others weren’t sure what was going on at all.
        This post is meant to finally clear everything up.
      </p>

      <p>
        In June 2025, Epic Games introduced new platform-level restrictions that prevented PixL's version of Fortnite from connecting to online matches. Because PixL relied on a custom distribution method to make
        Fortnite compatible with VoiD FX, this change made PixL’s Fortnite version unusable.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        In simple terms: the way PixL worked with Fortnite was blocked by Epic’s new rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was not a bug, not a temporary issue, and not something that could be fixed with an update.
        It was a permanent, platform-level change.
      </p>

      <h2>What Does This Mean?</h2>
      <p>Due to these restrictions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PixL can no longer safely provide Fortnite builds</li>
        <li>VoiD FX can no longer work with Fortnite the way it originally did</li>
        <li>Users attempting to use non-official versions may experience kicks, errors, or restrictions</li>
        <li>Continuing this system would risk user accounts and device security</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because of this, Fortnite support inside PixL had to be stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        This decision was made to protect users and avoid potential problems with accounts, bans, or unexpected behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Was PixL Abandoned?</h2>
      <p>
        No. PixL was not abandoned.
      </p>

      <p>
        What happened was an external platform change that removed a core part of how PixL functioned.
        Once that happened, continuing in the same direction was no longer viable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than pushing unsafe or broken updates, everything was paused while a new direction was planned.
      </p>

      <h2>The Future of PixL</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of trying to fight these restrictions, PixL will be evolving into something better and more sustainable:
      </p>

      <div class="future-box">
        A dedicated app store for our mods, tools, and future projects.
      </div>

      <h2>Thank You</h2>
      <p>
        If you’ve been using PixL from the beginning, thank you for sticking around.
        Your support genuinely matters, and this change is being made to ensure PixL can continue to exist, not disappear.
      </p>

      <p class="thanks">
        More details about the new version of PixL will be shared soon.

    <h2>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</h2>

    <p><strong>Do we collect personal information?</strong><br>
    We do not collect personal information directly. Third-party services we use, such as <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>, <strong>Unity Ads</strong>, and <strong>Patreon</strong> (for membership verification), may collect limited information automatically for analytics, crash reporting, advertising, and ad-free membership status checks. <strong>We have no control over the data collection practices of these third-party services.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Do we process sensitive personal information?</strong><br>
    No, we do not process sensitive personal information.</p>

    <p><strong>Do we collect any information from third parties?</strong><br>

    <p><strong>How do we process your information?</strong><br>
    We do not process or use personal information ourselves. Any information is handled exclusively by third-party services integrated into our app, including <strong>Patreon</strong> for membership verification. <strong>Our only interaction with third-party data is a minimal check via the Patreon API to confirm your membership status for ad-free functionality, and we do not store or further process this data.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>In what situations and with which parties do we share personal information?</strong><br>
    We do not share personal information directly. However, third-party services like <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Unity</strong>, and <strong>Patreon</strong> may collect and process data as part of their operation.</p>

    <p><strong>How do we keep your information safe?</strong><br>
    We do not store your personal data. The services we use (<strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Unity</strong>, and <strong>Patreon</strong>) employ their own data security systems.</p>

    <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong>,</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase</strong> (Crashlytics, Cloud Messaging, and Analytics),</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Ads</strong>,</li>
        <li><strong>Patreon</strong> (for ad-free membership verification),</li>
    </ul>
    <p>may automatically collect information, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device model, OS version, and identifiers (such as your <strong>Android Advertising ID</strong>).</li>

        <li>App usage data, such as how you interact with ads and features.</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>We have no control over the data collection practices of these third-party services, and any data they collect is governed by their own privacy policies.</strong> All payments for ad-free memberships are processed exclusively by <strong>Patreon</strong>, and we do not collect or store any payment information.<br>

    <h2>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <h2>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the <strong>European Economic Area (EEA)</strong>, <strong>United Kingdom (UK)</strong>, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, and <strong>Canada</strong>, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
    <p>In some regions (like the <strong>EEA</strong>, <strong>UK</strong>, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, and <strong>Canada</strong>), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<strong>HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</strong>" below.</p>
    <p>For <strong>Patreon</strong>-related data, you can manage your membership and associated data directly through your Patreon account settings, as we do not store or control this information.</p>
    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
    <p>If you are located in the <strong>EEA</strong> or <strong>UK</strong> and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or <strong>UK</strong> data protection authority.</p>
    <p>If you are located in <strong>Switzerland</strong>, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
    <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<strong>HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</strong>" below.</p>
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

    <h2>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("<strong>DNT</strong>") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing <strong>DNT</strong> signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to <strong>DNT</strong> browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser <strong>DNT</strong> signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring <strong>DNT</strong> signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
